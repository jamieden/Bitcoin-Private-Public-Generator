# Bitcoin-Private-Public-Generator

This Java program is designed to generate all possible HEX private keys within a certain range (BTCPrivateV2) and convert the keys to WIF format and to a public address (BTCSort). All outputs are saved to a text file in the project folder. The project currently only works when compiled in Eclipse and does not have a UI, and the public address generator could use some fixing up, however, in it's current state, it works.
